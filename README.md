User Registration Form with Validation and API Data Fetching

Project 1: Form Validation with JavaScript
Overview
I implemented a simple client-side form validation using JavaScript to check inputs for a username, email, and password. Upon submission, the form validates:

Username: Minimum 3 characters.
Email: Must contain @ and ..
Password: At least 8 characters long.
If all validations pass, a success message is displayed; otherwise, error messages are shown. The form submission is prevented until all inputs are valid.

Features:
Validates username, email, and password.
Displays real-time feedback.
Prevents form submission on errors.
How to Run:
Clone or download the project.
Open index.html in a browser.
Submit the form to see validation results.

Project 2: API Data Fetching and Display
Overview
I created a script that fetches user data from the public API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users and displays it in a list on the webpage. Error handling is implemented to show a message if the data fetch fails.

Features:
Fetches user data asynchronously.
Displays user names in a list.
Handles potential errors.

How to Run:
Clone or download the project.
Open index.html in a browser to see user data fetched from the API.
